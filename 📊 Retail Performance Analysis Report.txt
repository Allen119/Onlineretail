📊 Retail Performance Analysis Report
✅ Question 1: Monthly Revenue Time Series (2011) – CEO
🎯 Objective:

Understand monthly revenue patterns across 2011 to detect seasonality and inform planning.
📈 Key Findings:

    Strong Revenue Growth (April–November):

        Gradual rise from April, peaking in October–November.

        Likely driven by stabilized customer behavior, effective mid-year marketing, and successful holiday campaigns.

        Indicates this is the prime window for revenue generation.

    Sharp Decline (November to January):

        Revenue drops significantly post-November, continuing into December and January.

        Potential reasons include:

            Inventory stockouts after festive sales

            Payment delays and winter weather disruptions

            Possible missing data in December (to be audited)

📌 Strategic Recommendations:

    Focus investments and campaigns heavily between April and November.

    Address Q1 slowdowns with New Year offers and logistics planning.

    Prepare post-November inventory buffers and execute winter promotions to mitigate year-end drop.

🎯 Objective:

Visualize and target the most valuable customers to enhance retention and revenue.
📈 Key Insights:

    Revenue is heavily concentrated in the top 5 customers.

    There's a sharp decline in revenue contribution beyond the top few.

    Indicates a long-tail customer base, but high dependency on a few key accounts.

📌 Recommendations:

    Prioritize personalized service and satisfaction for top customers.

    Offer loyalty programs, exclusive deals, or premium support tiers.
